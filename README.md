# Week-2-Portfolio-Website

## Description

The motivation behind this Portfolio project was to have a place where I can showcase the skills that I have learned in the bootcamp and how I am progressing. This portfolio will hopefully show employers the skills and languages that I'm versatile on and make me employer-ready!

## Usage

Upon landing on the Portfolio website, you will be able to see a hero image with a header on the left and a navbar on the top right hand side. Below the hero image, you will find a main section with a section for projects I've completed taking up the majority of the screen width and to the right there is an about me section. Below the main section you will find a contact form where you can contact me should you have any questions!
